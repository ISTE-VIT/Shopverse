# Shopverse
Shopverse is an enabling experience that supports vulnerable citizens during the covid pandemic by providing consumer-friendly services in both real-time and field time through a solution that is easy and interactive.

## About
Shopverse serves as a user guide as well as an execution manual for developers. The main purpose of our project is to improve the shopping experience and reduce the time required for shopping by the user, by providing a hassle-free approach as well as enabling vulnerable citizens during the covid pandemic to shop with ease.

## Features
* Business owners can register as a shopkeeper and set up their business. They will get a Unique QR Code for their shop, which the customers can use to access their inventory.
* Users can register as customers and make their shopping less time-consuming and more efficient.
* For the shopkeeper, he can view all his pending orders and update them accordingly. He can also update the list of items that are available at his shop.
* The buyer is connected to the shop using QR Code, and can only browse for items that are available in that shop. With the feature of token generated, the user will not have to wait in long queues at shops.
* Users will also get a notification on their device if the items they wanted but were not available earlier are now in stock.
* Developers will give options to users to help improve the ‘Search by image’ option by helping expand the database.
